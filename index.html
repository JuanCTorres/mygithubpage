<h3>Experience</h3>
<p>I have worked as a section leader for the <a href="http://cs.dartmouth.edu">Computer Science Department</a>
  at Dartmouth during Spring 2015 and Winter 2016. In this capacity
  I have helped students understand the course material, have guided them through
  programming assignments, and have helped fix, debug, and improve their programs.
  I have also graded their coursework and exams.
</p>
<p>
  Guiding students who are just getting acquainted with data structures, sorting
  algorithms, and seeing them master this knowledge by applying it to various
  small-scale projects has been very rewarding.
</p>

<h3>Skills</h3>

<p>I feel most comfortable in <b>Python</b>, <b>Java</b>, and <b>C</b>.</p>

<p>I have also programmed in C++, Shell script, MatLab <p>

<p>Other tools I have used include <a href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/">Logisim</a>,
   Y86 (a reduced instruction set of X86 assembly), LaTeX, Haskell, and HTML.
 </p>

<h3>Other</h3>
<p>
  I am a passionate learner of human languages. I speak Spanish, some French, and a bit of Latin.
</p>
<p>
  I also enjoy photography. Feel free to take a look.
