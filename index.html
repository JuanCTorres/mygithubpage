    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I am interested in compilers and programming languages, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. I am also
        interested in various aspects of design, as well as linguistics, and photography. </p>

                    Jupiter is a startup looking to make reading classic works (and eventually more)
                    much more accessible by letting you skim them.

                <p>
                    During my time there, I created a pipeline to transform Project Gutenberg books into
                    mobile-friendly, more uniform documents that could be shown and manipulated easily by a mobile
                    application, and so that we could easily extract data for machine-learning applications, such
                    as recommending content to users.

                    I have worked as a section leader for the <a href="http://cs.dartmouth.edu">Computer Science
                    Department</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this capacity I have helped students understand course materials, have guided them through
                    programming assignments, and have helped fix, debug, and improve their programs.
                    I have also graded their coursework and exams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Guiding and assisting students who are just getting acquainted with various aspects of
                    Computer Science and programming and seeing them master this knowledge by applying it to various
                    small-scale projects has been a very rewarding experience, and a great refresher.

        <h3>Skills</h3>

        <p>I feel most comfortable in <b>Python</b> (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy), <b>Kotlin</b>, <b>Java</b>, <b>C</b>,
            and
            <b>Matlab</b>.
        </p>

        <p>I have also programmed in C++, Shell script, and Javascript.
        <p>

        <p>Other tools and languages I have used include <a href="http://www.cburch.com/logisim/">Logisim</a> (a
            digital-logic/circuit design & simulation tool),
            Y86 (a reduced instruction set of X86 assembly), Flex + Bison, LaTeX, Haskell, HTML + CSS, and Markdown.
        </p>

        <h3>Other</h3>
        <p>
            I am fascinated by design of various kinds, including UI/UX design and human-computer interaction
            (though I have only toyed around with them). I have done some graphic design over the years (flyers,
            infographics, some drawings),
            mostly using Illustrator and basic Photoshop, and I can use Lightroom.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a passionate learner of human languages. In addition to speaking Spanish natively, I speak some French,
            a
            bit of Latin, and some random facts and phrases in Korean.
