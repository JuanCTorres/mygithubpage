# Juan's personal page

This is a simple html page containing information about my interests and background.
 
At the moment I have no need for anything fancy, so it is a static page with responsive elements using Bootstrap
and some custom CSS. It should work well on most screen sizes. If you find a device that the page looks weird on, 
feel free to let me know.
